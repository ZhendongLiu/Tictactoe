# Tictactoe
  
  This java project demonstrates the implementation of alphaBeta - heuristic - depthLimited - minimax algorithm on the game Tic-tac-toe and advanced Tic-tac-toe. This program interacts with human via terminal, so the agents get input and give output via stdio.
  
  the write up explains my design.
 
  To play my program if you're interested, just download all files(including run.sh) to a UNIX machine directory and type command "bash run.sh"
